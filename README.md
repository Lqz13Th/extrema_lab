## **Overview**

Extrema Lab provides a structured workflow for quantitative research:

* **Data Management & Curation**: Collect, clean, preprocess, and standardize raw market data from multiple sources.
* **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful signals from processed data and build a reusable feature library.
* **Model Building & Training**: Train machine learning and deep learning models, including hierarchical reinforcement learning agents, using robust and reproducible methodologies.
* **Backtesting & Validation**: Evaluate strategy performance under various historical and simulated market conditions to assess robustness and avoid overfitting.
* **Deployment & Production Optimization**: Integrate validated strategies into production systems, optimizing for low-latency execution and stability.
* **Performance Analysis & Reporting**: Continuously monitor live strategies, analyze returns and risk, and provide actionable insights for strategy improvement.

## **Usage**

Run each stage of the pipeline using the corresponding script:

```bash
# Data acquisition and preprocessing
python data_proc/data_automation.py

# Feature engineering
python feature_eng/feat_automation.py

# Model training
python scripts/run_train.py

# Backtesting
python scripts/run_backtest.py

# Deployment
python scripts/run_deploy.py

# Performance analysis
python scripts/run_analysis.py
```

You can also import core modules for interactive research in Jupyter notebooks:

```python
from data_proc import data_automation
from feature_eng import feat_automation
```
