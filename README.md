Overview

Extrema Lab provides a structured workflow for quantitative research under Extrema Intelligence's methodology:

Data Management & Curation: Collect, clean, preprocess, and standardize raw market data from multiple sources.

Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful predictive signals and build a reusable feature library.

Model Building & Training: Train machine learning and deep learning models, including hierarchical reinforcement learning agents, using robust and reproducible methodologies.

Backtesting & Validation: Evaluate strategy performance across historical and simulated market conditions to ensure robustness and minimize overfitting.

Deployment & Production Optimization: Integrate validated strategies into production systems with low-latency, high-stability execution.

Performance Analysis & Reporting: Monitor live strategies, analyze returns and risk, and provide actionable insights for continuous optimization.
